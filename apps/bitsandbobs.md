# Create a treasure trove of your own bits & bobs.

We all have little things we want to keep track of. Maybe you’re looking to keep a record of your most prized possessions, a catalog of your vintage memorabilia, or your proudest collection of figurines. A top-10 list for your favorite movies you’ve watched or restaurants you’ve tried. Maybe a list of souvenirs from your favorite places you’ve visited, or even a checklist of all the places you want to visit in the future. Whatever you’re collecting, Bits & Bobs can help.

# Collections, checklists, and rankings.

Create a new collection in the app, and then add all the items in your collection to it. You might opt for a checklist – which lets you keep track of which items you have and which you don’t – or a ranking – which assigns numbers to each item so you can rank your favorites. 

# Attributes, tags, images, and more.

You can write descriptions for each item, put in images, and add tags to filter them by. There’s also item attributes – properties of whatever you’re collecting. They can be numerical, text-based, or true/false. With each item having its own value, you can sort all the items in the collection, group them together by their attributes, or filter for certain values. 

# We hope the app will be useful to you in keeping track of your own bits and bobs!
