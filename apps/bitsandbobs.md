# A simple but powerful app to keep track of your collections — a tracker for your personal items, experiences, and goals.

We all have little things we want to keep track of. Maybe you’re looking to keep a record of your most prized possessions, a catalog of your vintage memorabilia, or your proudest collection of figurines. A top-10 list for your favorite movies you’ve watched or restaurants you’ve tried. Maybe a list of souvenirs from your favorite places you’ve visited, or even a checklist of all the places you want to visit in the future. Whatever you’re collecting, Bits & Bobs can help.
