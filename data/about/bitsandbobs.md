**Welcome to Bits & Bobs – an app that helps you keep track of your collections and organize your most treasured possessions.**

Whatever you collect, Bits & Bobs can help keep track of it. From vinyl records, to collectible coins, to your favorite toys, figurines, books, seashells, cars, antique furniture, souvenirs, keepsakes, and so much more.

Create a new collection in the app, and then add all the items in your collection to it. You might opt for a checklist – which lets you keep track of which items you have and which you don’t – or a ranking – which assigns numbers to each item so you can rank your favorites.

You can write descriptions for each item, add photos, and add tags. There are also item attributes – properties of whatever you’re collecting. You can sort the items in the collection, group them together by their attributes, or filter for certain values.
