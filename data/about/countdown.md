Celebrate every moment with Countdown Creator – create beautiful countdown widgets to look forward to your next occasion.

Countdown cards are completely customizable. Add photos, text styles, and colors to make your countdown look great. Search for beautiful high-quality photos with Unsplash, built right into the app. Or use photos from your own photo library.

Holidays are built-in for easy countdown setup, with over 20 to choose from: national holidays, religious observances, and cultural celebrations. Just select the holiday you want, and we’ll create it for you – no need to figure out the date. Plus, the countdown rolls over to the next year once the holiday passes.

Use the Messages app to send countdowns to friends. Select the Countdown Creator iMessage app in the drawer, and simply choose a countdown to send. Your friend will receive a copy of your countdown, and they can save it on their own device.

Easily display widgets on your home screen. Choose a countdown from the widget settings and see how many days are left at a glance. You’ll receive a notification when the countdown is done, and you’ll be treated to a confetti celebration. And with iCloud sync, your countdowns are always up-to-date across all your devices.
