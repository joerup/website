<!-- ### Holidays built in. 

Over 20 to choose from: national holidays, religious observances, and cultural celebrations. Just select the holiday you want, and the app will automatically set it up for you – no need to figure out the date. Plus, the countdown rolls over to the next year once the holiday passes.

### Customizable cards. 

Add photos, and edit fonts and colors to make your countdown look great. Search for beautiful high-quality photos with Unsplash, built right into the app. Or use photos from your own photo library.

### Widgets. 

Choose a countdown in the widget settings, and you’ll always be able to see how many days are left, right on your home screen. Your photos, fonts, and colors also show up on widgets. 

### Notifications. 

Get reminder notifications when your countdown ends.

### iCloud sync. 

Countdowns automatically sync between your devices, so you can access them anywhere. -->
